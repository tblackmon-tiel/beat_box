# Beat Box
Beat Box is a project for Mod 1 of Turing designed to teach the creation and usage of linked lists. The end goal is to be able to provide a string of "beats", which will be converted into a linked list and "beat boxed" by the computer's text-to-speech reader.

I'm sure more will go here eventually...
